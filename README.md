> Manager your Destiny Clan

I wanted to build the clan manager because I wanted to expand on what the offical companion app already had. I felt it was lacking some easy improvements. 

In DCM you will be able to see all of your clan members that have or haven't completed the raid, nightfall, or trials of nine for that week on all three of the their characters. It will also show you your clan rewards, clan level, and much more. 

The App is in it's very early stages. If you have any suggestions for features go [here](https://github.com/itegrootenhuis/Destiny-Clan-Manager/issues/1) and comment below. If you have the skill set and wanna make a pull request feel free to do so. 

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
